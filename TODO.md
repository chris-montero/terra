[ ] maybe have separate `set_bounding_geometry`, `set_drawing_geometry`, `get_bounding_geometry` and `get_drawing_geometry` functions, instead of just having `set_geometry` and `get_geometry`. This could be very useful in cases where you want to layer children in a <terra.oak.elements.branches.el> container, you want one of the children to be "anchored" to the relative x & y coordinates of the parent "el", you want this child to draw something, but you don't want it to take up any space in the "el" parent. In this case, you could override the `get_bounding_geometry` and make it `return x, y, 0, 0`. This way, the element would still be allowed to be anchored to the parent and draw, but would not take up any space in the layout.

[ ] we need a good way to set and get the shape of an element. Additionally, we need to find a way to clip the sub-children of the element to its shape so that they can't draw outside of it. Additionally, we need to find a way to "punch holes" into an element, and be able to "see through" that hole AND click through it. I think the way I'm going to make all of this work is by having a "shape" property. I'm pretty sure cairo lets save a shape, and also lets you do "is_mouse_inside" or something like that, which would basically solve all of our issues. I'm also thinking that it would be nice to have a "clip_through_parent" property which would essentially "punch" a hole through the parent in the shape of the child. The reason this might be a good idea is because later on, if I'm going to be optimizing everything to only redraw its before/after geometry, moving the child (and thus moving the "hole") would also be optimized with this system.
